          <p class="otherparts">Okay, let's dive into Alphabet Inc.'s HR practices.
            The recruitment process at Alphabet is no ordinary one, take it from the company that receives</p> <p class="part1">millions of resumes every year.</p><p class="otherparts">
            Applicants are </p><p class="part2">interviewed by a set of at least four to five interviewers,</p><p class="otherparts"> with each interviewer grading the candidate based on specific </p> <p class="part3">skill sets.</p> 
            <p class="otherparts"> This process ensures that the company employs</p><p class="part4">only the brightest minds.</p> <p class="otherparts">Not to mention, their recruitment guidelines such as </p><p class="part5">"Don't be evil"</p> <p class="otherparts">and</p> <p class="part6">"Do the right thing"</p><p class="otherparts"> are a testament to the company's values.</p>
            <p class="otherparts">But this is just the beginning. Once you're on board, the company offers an </p><p class="part7">extensive training and development program.</p> <p class="otherparts"> This program provides employees with ample opportunities to </p><p class="part8">learn,</p><p class="part9"> grow</p><p class="otherparts">and</p>  <p class="part10">excel</p>  <p class="otherparts">in their field.
            The emphasis on performance evaluation policies is highly apparent, with every employee being evaluated on their accomplishments, contribution to the team, and ability to meet its goals. And let's talk about employee perks and benefits. Not only does Alphabet offer competitive pay scales, but they also provide ample insurance coverage, access to on-site gyms, childcare subsidies, and even free gourmet meals - the ultimate cherry on top!</p> <p class="part11">In a nutshell, the HR practices at Alphabet Inc.
            are designed to attract, retain and grow the best talent in the world.</p>  <p class="otherparts">Who wouldn't want to work in a place that treats its employees like royalty, right?!</p>
