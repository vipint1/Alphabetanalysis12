                <p>Alphabet Inc. is an American multinational technology conglomerate holding company headquartered in Mountain View, California. 
                    It was created through a restructuring of Google on October 2, 2015,and became the parent company of Google and several former Google subsidiaries.
                    Alphabet is the world's third-largest technology company by revenue and one of the world's most valuable companies.
                    It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.
                    The establishment of Alphabet Inc. was prompted by a desire to make the core Google business "cleaner and more accountable" while allowing greater autonomy to group companies that operate in businesses other than Internet services.
