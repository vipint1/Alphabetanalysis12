        <p class="apsh"> Alphabet&#39;s Primary Subsidiary</p>
        <p class="apsc">Google - Alphabet's Primary Subsidiary Now that we have looked into Alphabet Inc.'s introduction, 
            it's time to dive into their primary subsidiary, Google. Starting as a search engine, Google has 
            now become an integral part of people's lives. If you need a question answered, you just say "Google 
            it"! Google's background and history, started in 1998 by two Stanford University students, Larry Page, 
            and Sergey Brin. Initially named Backrub, the search engine's name was later changed to Google in reference
            to the term "googol," which means 1 followed by 100 zeros. Google's mission statement initially was to "organize
            the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful." Fast forward to the present day and Google
            offers a wide range of services and products. In addition to the iconic search engine, Google offers a web browser
            (Chrome), an operating system (Android and Chrome OS), a suite of productivity tools (Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides),
            and a video-sharing platform (YouTube), to name a few. Google is also known for its hardware devices such as Google Pixel
            smartphones, Google Home speakers, and Nest smart home devices. Google's impact is not limited to just the tech industry.
            The company has played a key role in shaping the advertising industry by introducing targeted ads. Advertisers can choose
            whom they want to show their ads to, based on interests, geography, and more. This technology has revolutionized the way
            businesses advertise. Google's diversity and reach are truly impressive, and it plays a crucial role in Alphabet Inc.'s
            success. But, how did Alphabet Inc. become a conglomerate of diverse companies? That's what we will look into in the next section.
