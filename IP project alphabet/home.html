               So you must be familiar with Google right? But have you ever heard of Alphabet Inc.? 
               You might be thinking, what's that? It's a company that Google created in 2015 to act 
               as a holding company for Google and all its other products and subsidiaries. 
               But let's step back a bit. Google itself wasn't always Google we know now,
               it started as a research project by two PhD students, Larry Page and Sergey Brin,
               at Stanford University in the late 90s. By the early 2000s, Google was the world's most popular
               search engine. However, as the company grew, it expanded into other areas such as mobile operating
               systems, web browsers, cloud computing, and many more. That’s when Alphabet came into the picture,
               creating a structure for all these different ventures to fall under one umbrella. Alphabet prides 
               itself on being innovative and continuously working towards making the world a better place through
               technology and creativeness. So what are Alphabet Inc.'s biggest values? For starters, they believe 
               in putting the end-user first, which is why user experience is such a significant factor in the development 
               of their products. Moreover, innovation is embedded deep in the philosophy of Alphabet, and they encourage 
               their employees to come up with innovative ideas to solve world problems.
